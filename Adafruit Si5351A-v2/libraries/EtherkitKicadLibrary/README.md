Etherkit KiCad Library
======================

This is the master library for all of the Etherkit products created with KiCad.

The library was converted to the new *pretty* format. To use it in your KiCad installation, go to Preferences > Library Tables. Chose the "Project Specific Libraries" tab, then click the "Append Row" button. Copy the text below, then paste it into the first cell of the new table row.

    (fp_lib_table
      (lib
        (name EtherkitKicadLibrary)
        (type Github)
        (uri https://github.com/etherkit/EtherkitKicadLibrary)
        (options "")
        (descr "This is the master library for all of the Etherkit products created with KiCad.")
      )
    )
    
The older version of the footprint library is still available in the root.
